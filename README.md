# Covid-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The primary focus is to understand:

* COVID-19 spread across countries and continents

* Death and case rates over time

* Impact of vaccination rollout on cases and fatalities

## Dataset

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

## Tools & Technologies

Excel: Removed unnecessary columns and split into two organized files (Deaths & Vaccinations).

SQL: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tableau: Dashboard


## Key Analyses Performed

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Count of total rows and unique countries

* Date range of data coverage

* Subset of relevant columns for analysis

COVID Case and Death Trends

* Total global cases, deaths, and death percentage

* Country-specific death percentages (USA, India, China)

* Case Fatality Rate (CFR) per country

* Percentage of population infected over time (global and country-level)

* Top 10 countries by total cases, deaths, case rate, and death rate

Vaccination Analysis

* Global vaccination coverage

* Rolling vaccination numbers per country

* Percentage of population vaccinated (partial and full)

* Comparison of total cases before vs. after vaccine rollout

* Top 10 most vaccinated countries

Combined Insights

* Relationship between vaccination rates and death rates

* Trends showing the effect of vaccines on case reduction
  

## SQL Queries

* The analysis is entirely SQL-based and includes:

* Data extraction and filtering

* Aggregations and grouping

* Window functions for rolling totals

* CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for vaccination percentages

* Joins between death and vaccination datasets
