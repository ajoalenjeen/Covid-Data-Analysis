# Covid-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the global impact of COVID-19 using Excel, SQL for data querying and analysis, and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to identify key patterns in case counts, deaths, and country-level Case Fatality Rates (CFR%) while presenting the findings in an easy-to-understand format.
